* COMPLETED 'Cleaned' libclang wrappers
  CLOSED: [2020-12-14 Mon 20:08]
  :LOGBOOK:
  - State "COMPLETED"  from              [2020-12-14 Mon 20:08]
  :END:

- [X] Instead of simply dropping duplicate enum values generate
  constants with dropped names.
- [X] Improve enum name conversion algorithm to also drop ~CXX~ in in
  the name.
- [X] Completely remove underscores from generated type and function
  names

* TODO Todo list

  :END:

- [X] Create fully qualified namespace access names
- [X] Default operators assignment, constructors, move etc.
- [X] Follow typedef alias dependencies
- [X] Wrap alias as ~type A = B~ instead of declaring separate object
- [ ] For all procs that have special arguments (wrappers for default
  arguments, newly generated args, removed, compressed and so on) should
  provide additional documentation for such parameters (via ~@arg{}~
  annotation).
- [ ] ~static~ fields
- [ ] Convert distinct types (or enums) for 'special integers' like
  sourcetrail ids, and create overloads that use them. Mark original procs
  as ~deprecated~. Implement overloads as ~{.inline.}~ with ~{.push
  warning[Deprecated]:off.}~ in body. Functions that /return/ 'special
  integer' mmust be wrapped as ~funcNameRaw~. Result will be converted to
  corresponding enum/distincty type
- [ ] Collect macro constant definitions into enums and use them for
  overloads from previous step.
- [ ] Do not create constructors procs for abstract classes
- [ ] Make closure override opt-in instead of opt-out feature as it largely
  useless for most libraries.
  - [ ] operator overloading reimplementation is broken and needs partial
    logic refactoring to fix.
- [ ] Documentation templating system.

  :END:

- [ ] ~cxx11~ namespace is not correctly collapsed for wrapping methods.
- [ ] Multiple annonymous enums are converter to the same name
- [ ] Generated ~importcpp~ for nested anonymous enums is incorrect.
