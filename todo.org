* COMPLETED 'Cleaned' libclang wrappers
  CLOSED: [2020-12-14 Mon 20:08]
  :LOGBOOK:
  - State "COMPLETED"  from              [2020-12-14 Mon 20:08]
  :END:

- [X] Instead of simply dropping duplicate enum values generate
  constants with dropped names.
- [X] Improve enum name conversion algorithm to also drop ~CXX~ in in
  the name.
- [X] Completely remove underscores from generated type and function
  names

* Wrapper generator

- [X] Follow typedef alias dependencies
- [ ] Wrap alias as ~type A = B~ instead of declaring separate object
- [ ] Do not create constructors procs for abstract classes
- [ ] Make closure override opt-in instead of opt-out feature as it largely
  useless for most libraries.
  - [ ] operator overloading reimplementation is broken and needs partial
    logic refactoring to fix.

* TODO Todo list
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CREATED:  <2020-12-16 Wed 00:06>
  :END:

- [X] Create fully qualified namespace access names
- [ ] Default operators assignment, constructors, move etc.
- [ ] For all procs that have special arguments (wrappers for default
  arguments, newly generated args, removed, compressed and so on) should
  provide additional documentation for such parameters (via ~@arg{}~
  annotation).
